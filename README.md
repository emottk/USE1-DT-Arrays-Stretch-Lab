# â™« 99 Bottles of Pop

Using all that we've learned about loops, write a piece of code that will print out the entire song. For example:

  99 bottles of pop on the wall, 99 bottles of pop! Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of pop on the wall!

There are many ways to get this done - be creative!
Also, take a look at this [Ruby Doc](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/Range.html) about ranges. This would be a great place to start.
